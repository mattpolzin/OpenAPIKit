Thank you for considering contributing to OpenAPIKit!

Take a look at the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/mattpolzin/OpenAPIKit/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and note the [MIT license](https://github.com/mattpolzin/OpenAPIKit/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) associated with this project.

Please do the following in the course of preparing a branch and pull request for this project.

- Create an issue motivating the changes you've made if one does not already exist. If you are unsure of how to adress an issue, seek out converstation on the issue before committing to a strategy.
- Add test cases that cover the logical branches of your addition. For bug fixes, at least one of your test cases should fail prior to your change to serve as a regression test against the bug being fixed.
- If relevant, cite the OpenAPI specification in describing your changes.
- If your changes only apply for OpenAPI 3.1.x documents, modify the `OpenAPIKit` module. If your changes only apply for OpenAPI 3.0.x documents, modify the `OpenAPIKit30` module. If your changes apply to both, please port your changes from one to the other so both are updated if you have time. If you don't have time to apply changes to both modules, create a PR and ask for assistance with porting your changes. If you are not sure whether your changes apply to both modules, you can also create a PR and then ask for clarification.

Thanks!
